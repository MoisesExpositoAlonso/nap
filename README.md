# Interactive shiny R plot of allele frequencies under a Wright-Fisher population

Tune the forces of evolution: mutation, migration, selection, and drift (including also non-random mating); to simulate allele frequencies under the classic population genetics equations.

``` sh
# Packages required
library(ggplot);library(cowplot) # for plotting
library(shiny) # for the interactive app

# To start the app just run:
run_GitHub("popgensim","MoisesExpositoAlonso")
